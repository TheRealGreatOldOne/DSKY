Code and other files from by DSKY replica build. Based on the work of bschymanski and his DSKY_RaspberryPI_virtualAGC code, plus others.

Boot.py and Code.py are for setting up the keyboard HID interface with a RPI PICO2040. 
Keyboard lighting handles setting the correct hue and brightness for the neopixels in the keys. 
piDSKY-jc.py is modified from bschymanski's code to use my lamp setup and is used to inteface between the DSKY and virtual AGC (which should be running on the Pi). 

All STLs etc are on printables here: https://www.printables.com/model/915550-apollo-dsky-agc-display-keyboard/files
